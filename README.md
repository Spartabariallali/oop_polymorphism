Poly means many
Morph means change
Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object taking many forms.
Python being an OOP supports Polymorphism through Method overriding and operator overloading.
Polymorphism can be achieved through inheritance - Method overriding
Method overriding provides ability to change the implementation of a method in a child class which is already defined in one of its super class or parent class.
If there is a method in a super class the method having the same name number of arguments in a child class is said to be overriding the parent class method.
We can use the concept of polymorphism while creating class methods as Python allows different classes to have methods with the same name.
We can then later generalise calling these methods by disregarding the object we are working with.
